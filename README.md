# ChainLearn
an attempt to learn different blockchain


#MultiChain
Multichain is a blockchain platform based on the Bitcoin blockchain code. Multichain 1.0 is used for implementing digital asset transactions between participating nodes and also to store addition data along the transactions. With security implementation which helps in permissioned blockchain.

#Native Assets
Multiple chain gives a provision for creating millions of digital assets and initiate transactions for transfer of assets between addresses on the nodes. Nodes with create asset permission can create any number of assets. Nodes with transfer asset permission can transact with assets. Also nodes need to have permission to recieve assets too.

#Streams
Streams in multi chains helps in storing key value pairs on chain with time stamp against it. Nodes can store any number of data on the stream and this will be shared with nodes subscribed with the particular stream. Again all these are driven by permission.
